## Readme text for the codes and data.

1. `Simulation_Code.R` script is the main R script that simulates population collapses going through fold and transcritical bifurcation following the two equations in the main-text.

2. `Simulation_analyses_code.R` is the script that categorizes the data based on sampling lenghts, resolutions, different forcing strengths, and for different bifurcation types.

3. R script named `01_Simulation_Fig_1_code.R` that generates figure 1 of the maintext from data `analyzedFold.RData` and `analyzedTrans1.RData`. 

4. R script named `02_simulation_Figure_2_code.R` that generates figure 2 of the maintext from data `analyzedFold.RData` and `analyzedTrans.RData`.  

5. R scripts named `3.MicrocosmAnalysis.R` that creates data based on time series lengths and resolution from the microcosm data **microcosm_data.csv** of Clements & Ozgul (2016) *Nat. comms*. Using `04_microcosm_data_fig_3_4.R` script will generate figure 3 and 4 of the main-text.
